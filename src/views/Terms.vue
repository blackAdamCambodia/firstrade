                <h3 class="font-[700] py-4 font-sans text-2xl ">Hyperlinks</h3>
                <p>Firstrade may make available links from a Firstrade web site to other, third party sites or electronic
                    services providers that are not affiliated with Firstrade. Firstrade does not control these other sites
                    or services, and Firstrade makes no representations or endorsements whatsoever concerning those sites or
                    services. The fact that Firstrade has provided links to other web sites or references to other products,
                    services or publications does not imply the endorsement, approval, authorization, sponsorship, or
                    affiliation with respect to such web sites, products, services or publications by Firstrade, its agents
                    or its affiliates. There are risks in using any information, software, service or product found on the
                    Internet, and Firstrade cautions you to make sure you understand these risks before retrieving, using,
                    relying upon, or purchasing anything via the Internet. You agree that under no circumstances will you
                    hold Firstrade liable for any loss or damage caused by use of or reliance on any content, goods or
                    services available on other third party sites.</p>
            <h3 class="font-[700] py-4 font-sans text-2xl ">System Reliability</h3>
            <p>System response and access times may vary due to market conditions, system performance, and other
                factors. High volumes of trading and volatility may result in executions at prices significantly away
                from the price quoted or displayed at the time of order entry.</p>
            <p>Firstrade maintains sophisticated systems and employs experienced personnel to receive and process your
                transactions over the Internet. Information processing and communications systems, both our own and
                those of third parties, are subject to occasional congestion, technological problems, or in extreme
                cases, outages. Beyond our proprietary systems, third party providers include market centers that
                execute orders and quote vendors. Failure of a critical system for a significant period of time could
                limit our ability to process transactions in a timely and accurate manner.</p>

                historical data product. You may not use any of the data in connection with the issuance, trading,
                marketing or promotion of investment products (e.g., derivatives, structured products, investment funds,

                based on or related to the data) without a separate written agreement with us, the information service
                provider or third party, as the case may be, that has ownership rights to the data (e.g. Dow Jones &amp;
