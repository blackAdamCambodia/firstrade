                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold font-sans my-4">General</h3>
                <p>Access to any company's website can be challenging for persons having certain disabilities. A person's
                    disability is often unique. What may work well for one person, may cause difficulties for another
                    person. Our company has made efforts to accommodate as many of our customers and potential customers as
                    is reasonable given our size, resources, and knowledge of our customers, and potential customer's needs.
                    To that end we have engaged the services of professionals to assist and advise us in these matters. More
                    general information about website access and website access statements can be found at
