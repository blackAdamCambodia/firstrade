                                    <p>ORLANDO, FLORIDA – Hurricane Ian made landfall west of Fort Myers, Florida on
                                        September 28 as a Category-4 storm, causing many fatalities and catastrophic damage
                                        to cities in its path. In the aftermath, many Florida residents experienced
                                        displacement, flooding, power outages and damage to their homes.</p>
                                    <p class="py-3">Firstrade worked closely with the area’s main bottled water distributor, Blue Triton,
                                        and the largest church in Fort Myers (First Assembly of God - an official relief
                                        distribution center) to reach distressed communities in the Fort Myers area and
                                        supply them with 23 pallets of drinkable water.</p>
                                    <p>“Working directly with the local community enabled us to cut through the red tape and
                                        normal delays that occur in a crisis to get the relief to the affected communities
                                        sooner.” said Jeff Huang, CIO of Firstrade.</p>
                                    <p class="py-3">The cleanup and restoration process is expected to take some weeks, however Firstrade
                                        is continuing to support the Florida community during these testing times. The new
                                        Orlando FL branch and its support to the Floridian community is the start of
                                        continued initiatives in the state, to help the community get back on its feet after
                                        the devastation brought by Ian.</p>

                                    <p>On March 11, 2011 a 9.0 magnitude earthquake occurred off the coast of Japan. This
                                        triggered a tsunami with waves as high as 133 feet resulting in tens of thousands of
                                        deaths and injuries and hundreds of thousands displaced from their homes. After the
                                        disaster, Firstrade was there to help those in need get medical treatment, food,
                                        water and shelter.</p>
                                    <p class="py-3">We started our initiative by setting up a fund through the Red Cross and making a
                                        donation. Once word got out about our contribution, our amazing employees made it
                                        clear they wanted to take part and they began donating to the fund. In order to give
                                        our accountholders the opportunity to contribute, we also set up a link from our
                                        homepage to the Firstrade page on the Red Cross site.</p>
                                    <p>Finally, we offered free wire transfers allowing our accountholders to send money to
                                        banks in Japan for a month at no charge. This ensured that every dollar sent went
                                        right to those who needed it most.</p>
